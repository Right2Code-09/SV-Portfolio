## Namaste 🙏 I'm Harshit.

This is a basic portfolio website. I made this using Svelte and I am sure it will help you understand the Svelte algorithm.

What does Svelte mean ❓

## Answer. Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that is highly performant and easy to learn.

You should try Svelte if you are a beginner who wants to learn a Javascript framework since it is the easiest framework ever (in my opinion).

My first impression of Svelte is that it is very easy to understand what is going on on the screen (I found this very helpful for beginners).

Additionally, it is extremely performant 🚀 compared to other frameworks.

If you want to learn more about Svelte, you can read various articles. But it's very difficult to read and understand those long scripts.

Thus, I am creating a very interactive and beginner friendly Svelte course

You will find the course on my Youtube Page:- (https://www.youtube.com/@Right2Code-09/playlists) ❤

This course is designed to help people learn from the basics and move on to the advanced level. 🔥

I am sure it will help people learn Svelte quickly and effectively.
